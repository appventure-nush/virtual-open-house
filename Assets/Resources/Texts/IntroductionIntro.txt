Carlyne2;Hello there! Welcome to the NUS High Virtual School Tour! My name is Carlyne. 
Carlyne1;In this interactive tour, my friends and I will show you around the school and let you experience what NUS High has to offer, both inside and outside of the classroom.
Carlyne1;Before we begin, here's a quick guide on how to play.
Carlyne7;You can click anywhere on the screen to go to the next dialogue, or skip to the end of the current one.
Carlyne5;With the buttons below, you can go back to the menu or move to another location whenever you want!
Carlyne4;Within each location, there will be short videos that play to show you what life is like here in our school. 
Carlyne3;At the end of them, you can click 'Replay' to examine the current location further if you wish, or 'Location Select' / 'Category Select' to see somewhere new.
Carlyne6;Are you ready? Let's go!
